**Why Would You Use This?**

I rewatched _The Social Network_ recently, and guess what? I wanted to tackle the same challenge Zuckerberg threw down: "10 minutes to get a root access to a python web server; expose its ssl encryption and interecept all traffic over its secure ports." But- I don't have a Python server. So, I rolled up my sleeves and built my very own!

Use it for fun.

_Disclaimer: Please don't use for wrong purposes.  Not to mention, Don't go to wild, wild internet for this._

**Let the hacking begin!**
